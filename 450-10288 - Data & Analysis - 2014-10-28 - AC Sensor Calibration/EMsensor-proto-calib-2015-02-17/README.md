Data collected on the new external 2-circuit EM-coupled AC sensor.

Each sensor was tested individually for a range of power loads, while the other sensors had no current going through them.

Values for `v_bits`, `c1_bits`, and `c2_bits` are the _bit values_ from the analog input, averaged over the last 20 samples (about 2 seconds). `v_measured` and `c_*_measured` are in volts and amps, respectively.
