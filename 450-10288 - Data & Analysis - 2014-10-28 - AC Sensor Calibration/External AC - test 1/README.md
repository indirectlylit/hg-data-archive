Data collected on the external 3-circuit AC sensor.

Each sensor was tested individually for a range of power loads, while the other sensors had no current going through them.

Values for v, c_1, c_2, and c_3 are _bits_ averaged over the last 20 samples (about 2 seconds). v_measured and c_*_measured are in volts and amps, respectively.
